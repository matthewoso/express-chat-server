Before anything, run the command

	npm install

in this folder to download the node_modules for this assignment.

PART ONE:

Right now, we are just sending the messages as strings across to the server.

Change this so that a message consists of three parts:
	{
		text: "Hi",
		name: "Erty",
		time: 087345043
	}
Where the text is the main message text, the name is a "username" that the user provides, and the time is a UNIX timestamp representing when the message was sent.

The usernames do not need to be unique, secure, or anything. Simply provide a second text box for the user to set what username is sent to the server.

Store all of these data in the messages array on the server, and send them forward to the client on request.

Now, on the front end, display the name, time, and text of each message, instead of just the text.

PART TWO:

Write a new endpoint on the server, "/log/:username", which shows all of the messages sent by one user.

For example http://localhost:8080/log/erty will show a listing of all of the messages sent by user "erty".

As a hint, look up "req.params" in node/express.

You do not need to be able to send messages from this page. This is a page you will visit in the browser ("GET" request)

Optionally, make it so that clicking on a user's name takes you to their log page from the main chat ("/") page.
